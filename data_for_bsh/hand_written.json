        "copyright_details": "Diabetes, a chronic disease, affects 422 Million people globally. Monitoring Blood Glucose Level (BGL) many times a day for the diabetics are highly required. With the rise of artificial intelligence techniques, personalized BGL prediction devices could help to minimize the number of required sample collections, enabling diabetics to feel more pleasant, and live fulfilled lives. The key purpose of BGL prediction is to reduce the number of blood sample collections required in postprandial scenario which is specifically done after a meal, enabling users to live more active lives. The current work presents the basis of a precise estimation of BGL using a robust machine learning model to be incorporated into a personalized handheld healthcare device thus enhancing the next generation of mass consumer market BGL testers for diabetics. A person’s profile is identified by comparing with known training data and a comparative study checks the outcomes among the proposed methods. The proposed solution uses the Linear Regression within a lightweight prototype hardware unit to perform initial mapping in whole training data and reports an accuracy benchmark of above 99%.",

The huge collection of lung image data sets are used to train the SLCRDL. Then the patient’s taken lung image is inputted to the SLCRDL to know the cancer stage. By using this SLCRDL, the patient itself can know whether he/she is having cancer or not along with its stage. It gives smart safety recommendations to protect from further growth of the cancer as a precautionary basis. Also the doctors can make use of this SLCRDL to take initial decision up to a particular level.",
